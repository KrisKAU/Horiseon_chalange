## Improvements

* **Page Title:** Incorporating keyword-driven page titles not only enhances SEO by making your content more visible to search engines but also facilitates quicker comprehension of the page's content and purpose for users. 
* **Semantic HTML Structure:** By substituting generic container elements and class names with semantic elements and meaningful class names, I was refining the structure of the webpage to be more intuitive and descriptive.
* **Page Headings:** Ensured that heading elements follow a logical, sequential order.
* **Improved Image Accessibility:** Added **alt** attributes to `<img>` tags to improve the discriptions of the images in case (if from some resons,) images will not load proper way.


## Technologies
